\noindent\textbf{Part IV: Quality, Governance, and Capstone}

The final part addresses quality assurance, ethical considerations, and brings together all concepts through an end-to-end case study. Chapter~\ref{ch:testing} covers evaluation frameworks, robustness testing, and regression control---ensuring LLM systems maintain quality as they evolve. Chapter~\ref{ch:ethics} addresses the critical responsibility dimension of LLMOps, covering bias mitigation, privacy protection, safety guardrails, and governance frameworks. Chapter~\ref{ch:case-study} serves as a comprehensive capstone, walking through \ishtar{}'s complete lifecycle from design to deployment, highlighting lessons learned and best practices.

Together, these chapters emphasize that operational excellence in LLMOps extends beyond technical performance to encompass quality assurance, ethical responsibility, and continuous improvement. The \ishtar{} case study demonstrates how all principles from earlier chapters integrate into a cohesive, production-ready system.
