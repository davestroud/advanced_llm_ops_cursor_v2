\noindent\textbf{Part II: Delivery and Production Operations}

Once foundational concepts are established, Part II focuses on the operational practices that enable reliable deployment and maintenance of LLM systems in production. Chapter~\ref{ch:cicd} adapts continuous integration and deployment principles to the unique requirements of LLM systems, covering prompt testing, model validation, and safe release strategies. Chapter~\ref{ch:monitoring} addresses observability---both traditional infrastructure metrics and LLM-specific semantic signals---essential for understanding system behavior and detecting issues. Chapter~\ref{ch:scaling} completes this part by examining autoscaling strategies, capacity planning, and cost optimization techniques that allow LLM deployments to grow efficiently.

These chapters emphasize the practical discipline required to operate LLM systems reliably: automated testing gates, comprehensive monitoring, and intelligent scaling decisions. The \ishtar{} case study illustrates how these practices combine to support mission-critical applications under variable load.
